# CSCI X360: Data Science 2 - Project 2

## Group Number: 2

## Group Members:
* Spencer King
* Chandler Harris
* Nikhil Jindia
* Tango Nham


## Project Goal

Data Science II Project 2 - Modeling 5 datasets with neural networks and different activation functions: neural networks with 2 layers, neural networks with 3 layers, and Neural Networks with 4 or more layers.

Models:

1. Neural Net 2L
1. Neural Net 3L
1. Neural Net 5L

Activation Functions:

1. Sigmoid
2. Tanh
3. ReLU

## Project Organization

The project organized into 4 main folders: raw_data, cleaned_data, python, and scala. The raw_data folder is filled with the original datasets as they came from the original sources. The cleaned_data folder is filled with a formatted and cleaned version of the origional data. The python folder holds all of the Python code, and in that folder there should be a README_py.md file that outlines how to run all Python code. Finally, the scala folder holds all of the Scala code and ScalaTion packages, and in that folder there should be a README_scala.md with more specific instructions on how to run the Scala code. 

Under the main directory DS2_P2 there is also a results.xlsx, results_summary.doc, and a results_summary.pdf. These files outline the results from each of the models on each data set and then summarize them in a meaningful way.
