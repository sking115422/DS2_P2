# Scala Models Code

This folder named "scala" contains all relevant files needed to run the regression models on each dataset in scala. Each dataset should have its own object in scala/scalaTion_reg_models/src/main/scala/models/DataObj.scala. All files necessary to run the models in scala are contained under the scala/scalaTion_reg_models/src/main/scala/models directory. The files should be named logically and are broken up with respect to model implimentation. 

## Steps to Run Code

1. cd into the scala/scalaTion_reg_models directory
1. Run command: sbt
1. Run command: run
1. Choose the model and dataset combination you with to run from the list
1. Examine the output
